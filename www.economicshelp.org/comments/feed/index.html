Brown also hit the pension funds, apart from the stupid Brown bottom in gold. He also spent more than the growth in the economy for every year that labour were in power, which was completely irresponsible in view of the bubble that he created, which became the longest period of growth ever experienced in the UK and was  boasted about at the Labour party conference. Brown said he had eliminated &#039;boom and bust&#039; but merely created the biggest bust in UK history. And also PFI. Kush, wake up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a really minor technical comment. If inflation is now 10%, the index rises from 100 to 110. Should the nominal ¬£1,000 now be worth ¬£909 in real terms today? (¬£1,000/1.10) and not ¬£900?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still not seeing why 0 inflation is a bad thing. 2% robbery is still 2% robbery. The stability of knowing the dollar will buy today what it will buy tomorrow is called &quot;STABILITY&quot; and does not take a pHD to figure out tomorrows retirement dollars. Peg the dollar to gold and keep inflation at 0%. Limit trade with other countries. Ahhh... sweet isolation.]]></description>
