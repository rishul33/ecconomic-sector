										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1974, the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research made a report about the UK economy, concluding:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is not often that a government finds itself confronted with a possibility of a simultaneous failure to achieve all four main policy objectives: adequate economic growth, full employment, a satisfactory balance of payments, and reasonable, stable prices.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Two years later, the UK economy was in further difficulties, a run on the Pound, a large trade deficit, rising budget deficit and the UK rather embarrassingly was forced to go to the IMF for a loan. The IMF gave the UK the then-largest-ever loan of £3.5bn, but required deep cuts in public spending and higher interest rates to bring inflation under control. (See:<a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/132993/economics/uk-imf-crisis-of-1976/"> IMF Loan of 1976</a>)</p>
<p>Nearly 45 years later, we see some similarities, but also differences.</p>

<h3>Wage inflation</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27531" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1-600x438.png" alt="inflation-1970s" width="600" height="438" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1-600x438.png 600w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1-200x146.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1-500x365.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1-185x135.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1-300x219.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1-768x561.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inflation-1970s-1.png 891w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>In the 1970s, there was a supply-side shock with OPEC cutting oil supply causing the oil price to triple. This led to inflation of double-digit. However, in the 1970s, this initial burst of inflation led to rising nominal wages as workers successfully maintained real wage increases. This combination of rising costs and wages, pushed up inflation into double digits, reaching a peak of 24.2% in 1975.</p>
<p>In 2022, nominal wages are being squeezed as workers see falling real wages. There is little prospect of strong growth in real wages, as the government look to find spending cuts by keeping a lid on public sector pay.</p>

<p>Higher interest rates. In response to the IMF bailout, the UK increased interest rates to an eye-watering 14.5% in an effort to reduce inflation.</p>
<h3>What will happen to interest rates in UK?</h3>
<p>Interest rates were forecast to rise this summer, due to high inflation and the weak Pound. Also, the fact the US is tightening interest rates strengthens the dollar and puts pressure on other countries to also increase interest rates, so as not to lose too much value of the currency.</p>
<p>The mini-budget did cause an increase in the expected rise in interest rates as markets reacted to the inflationary impact and decline in public finances.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171108" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu.jpg" alt="implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu" width="917" height="618" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu.jpg 917w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu-185x125.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu-200x135.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/implied-path-of-interest-rates-benchu-500x337.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px" /></p>
<p>You can see that before the mini-budget, interest rates were forecast to rise to 4.0% in Jan 2023. The budget caused markets to price in interest rates of 6%. Since the 45p tax U-turn, Bank of England intervention and talk of strict spending limits, expected interest rates have fallen back to 5.5$ &#8211; still above the pre-budget level.</p>
<p>This is the cost of unfunded tax costs &#8211; higher mortgage payments and higher loan fees for business</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If interest rates do rise to 6%, we can see how mortgage payments as a % of income will rise to levels not since the housing price crash of the early 1990s. It is noticeable that in 1992, interest rates peaked at 15%, but now in 22, even a mortgage rate of 6% would cause big decline in affordability. The reason is house prices are so much higher and so average mortgages are much higher.</p>

<p>This is a similar graph showing interest rates adjusted for affordability.</p>
<p>An old student recently got in contact saying he was taking out a large mortgage and the new offer was either 2 years fixed at 5.5% or 5 years fixed at 5.5% which is better? Economic predictions over 6 months are notoriously difficult. But, it may be in the long-term, we return to the period of low-interest rates we have seen during the post-financial crash. I will explain in a later post. However, a fall in interest rates for two years hence will not be much comfort for those struggling with the cost of living now.</p>
<p><strong>Bank of England intervention</strong></p>
<p>To calm bond markets and prevent a meltdown in pension funds, the Bank of England stepped in to pursue a new form of quantitative easing where the goal is simply to stabilise bond markets and prevent rapid fall in bond prices. Their intervention has been quite effective, reversing some of the rising bond yields.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171117" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uk-gilts-boe.jpg" alt="uk-gilts-bank-of-england-september-2022-crisis" width="800" height="425" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uk-gilts-boe.jpg 800w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uk-gilts-boe-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uk-gilts-boe-185x98.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uk-gilts-boe-768x408.jpg 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uk-gilts-boe-200x106.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uk-gilts-boe-500x266.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The Bank of England made it very clear &#8211; who they blamed for the rise in gilt yields, pointedly contrasting rising UK yields with US and Euro area. It also shows how gilt purchases bought yields back down</p>
<p>As a result of this Bank policy, I heard a few jokes to the effect of &#8211; how come the chancellor lost £65bn on their first day in office &#8211; but he&#8217;s still in a job?</p>
<p>He certainly had a bad day at the office, but he didn&#8217;t lose £65bn for two reasons. Firstly, QE means the Central Bank creates money electronically. In other words, there is no opportunity cost of lower spending or higher taxes. Secondly, once the Bank of England started buying bonds (at low prices), bond prices rose and the Bank is technically sitting on a profit. The Bank could sell these bonds and make more money (in theory, though bond prices would also likely fall if they sold in a sudden). Whilst this intervention was successful, it is time limited. The government can&#8217;t rely on continued intervention. Creating money at this stage with inflation of 10% does create the risk of inflation. Before the crisis, the Bank was actually reversing QE and selling bonds. It will want to return to QT when it can. Therefore, although bond yields have recovered somewhat. However, as the Bank stopped buying bonds yesterday, bond yields have gone back up.</p>

<p>Yields rose when Bank stopped buying today.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong></p>
<p>Recently I made a post about <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/171036/economics/russia-v-europe-impact-of-economic-sanctions/">the Russian economy</a>, predicting that a global recession could cause a sharp fall in oil prices as it did in 2008 when oil prices slumped from $140 to $40.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171062" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web.png" alt="oil-prices-2003-2022-web" width="900" height="619" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-300x206.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-185x127.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-768x528.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-200x138.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-500x344.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>However, shortly after that OPEC+ (which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia) surprised many people by planning to cut output by 2 million barrels a day. Their reasoning is they don&#8217;t like recent falls in price (though others suspect geo-politics). This cut in oil supplies will reverse recent price falls and put upward pressure on inflation. It will also be a boon for the struggling Russian economy.</p>
<p><strong>Global recession</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/09/15/risk-of-global-recession-in-2023-rises-amid-simultaneous-rate-hikes">World Bank</a> has warned that simultaneous rate tightening across the world is increasing the risk of a 2023 recession.</p>
<p>Analysts say that there are early warning signs of a global recession in indicators such as a strong fall in German exports in July and worse sentiment among German exporters since Covid times (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/sentiment-among-german-exporters-its-lowest-since-may-2020-2022-09-27/">Reuters</a>) Even in the US leading indicators like rents and house prices are suggesting future problems. Analysts argue CPI and wage growth is more of a <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/21587/concepts/lagging-and-leading-indicators/">lagging indicator</a> and as a result the Fed may be tightening too much. Perhaps wanting to avoid a 1970s experience (though there is little evidence of 1970s-style wage inflation.)</p>
<p>How does a global recession affect UK households? Well, if the world goes into recession, it will definitely drag the UK further into recession, leading to unemployment and more downward pressure on living standards. Despite Brexit, we are more reliant on trade than many economies. Also, the negative effect of a global recession would feed through into lower investment and lower economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of tax changes</strong></p>
<p>Whilst there has been much coverage of the £43bn unfunded tax cuts. Another aspect of recent tax changes will actually raise revenue by stealth. This is the decision to freeze income tax thresholds &#8211; rather than rise in line with inflation. This matters because when inflation is high, more people will find themselves &#8211; paying tax and also moving into higher tax brackets. It is sometimes called bracket creep.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171112" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rising-tax-burden.png" alt="rising-tax-burden" width="801" height="679" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rising-tax-burden.png 801w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rising-tax-burden-300x254.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rising-tax-burden-185x157.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rising-tax-burden-768x651.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rising-tax-burden-200x170.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rising-tax-burden-500x424.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>
<p>This <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/reforms-roll-outs-and-freezes-tax-and-benefit-system">paper from IFS</a> shows how more adults will start paying income tax as more slip into the lower threshold for income tax.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Freezes to personal tax parameters alone will reduce households’ income by £1,250 on average by 2025–26. Adding in freezes to benefits and gradual policy roll-outs brings that figure to £1,450, or 3.3% of income, and means a £41 billion boost to the exchequer.</p>
<p>In other words, on average for every £1 households gain from high-profile cuts to rates of income tax and National Insurance, they lose £2 from the freezes and policy roll-outs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>How come taxes will be going up despite high-profile tax cuts?</h3>
<p>It reflects the poor performance of the UK economy. Declining labour participation, rising long-term sickness, Low growth, stagnant real incomes, but increased pressure on government spending (health care, pensions). This is why you can understand why a government would want the higher growth rates which characterised the post-war period &#8211; you can meet public spending without having to squeeze in tax increases. Whether the government&#8217;s tax cuts will do anything to boost economic growth, is highly debatable.

<li>UK bond yields are the rate of interest received by those holding Government bonds.</li>
<li>Governments sell bonds (also called gilts) via the Debt Management Office to fund their budget deficits. Bonds are a way for the government to borrow &#8211; a bit like the government taking out a loan.</li>
<li>Government bonds are frequently traded on bond markets. Therefore, their market price may be quite different to the original price set by the government.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example of why bond yield changes</h4>
<p>A government may sell a 10-year, £1,000 bond at 5% interest. This means every year the government will pay £50 to the holder of this bond.</p>
<ul>
<li>If demand for government bonds rose, this £1,000 bond would increase in price as investors pushed up the market price.</li>
<li>But, the government still pay £50 a year interest until maturity. If the market price of the bond rises to say £2,000, the interest rate (yield) is now 2.5% (50/2,000)</li>
<li>Therefore higher demand for bonds leads to lower bond yields.</li>
<li>Conversely, if people sell bonds, this pushes up the bond yield (e.g. what happened in UK September 2022)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How a change in price of a bond changes the effective yield</strong></p>

<h3>What is the importance of bond yields?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cost of Government Debt</strong>. If bond yields fall then the government can issue debt at low-interest rates. This makes it cheaper for the government to borrow. The UK spent around £45bn on <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/3028/economics/interest-payments-on-uk-debt/">interest payments</a> in 2011/12 and £83bn in 2022. If bond yields were higher, this interest rate cost would be much greater.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example. In 2022, UK debt is £2,347bn.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the average bond yield is 3.75%, annual interest is £88bn.</li>
<li>If average bond yield rose to 5.5%, the net annual debt interest payments would be £129bn.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is an extra £41billion &#8211; just from higher bond yields. It is worth noting that if bond yields rise, it will take longer for the average bond yield to rise because government debt is issued on a rolling pattern. i.e. Government debt is financed by bonds sold over the past 30 years.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>How Much Can a Government Borrow?</strong> If interest rates are low, this is an indication markets are willing to buy government debt. Therefore, the government can borrow more. If bond yields rise sharply, this indicates the private sector no longer wish to buy government bonds, and therefore the government will face much greater pressure to reduce borrowing soon.</li>
<li><strong>Forecast of future growth and inflation.</strong> Low bond yields may indicate an unwillingness to invest in private sector investment and reflect low growth.</li>
<li><strong>Future Inflation</strong>. Bond Yield curves can indicate future inflation trends. (see below)</li>
<li><strong>Rising bond yields may cause stock market falls</strong>. If bond yields rise, investors may prefer to sell stocks and buy bonds which give better yield.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate bonds</strong>. It is not just governments who sell bonds, companies do too. Corporate bonds are a way for firms to raise finance and fund investment. If bond yields rise, firms find it more expensive to borrow and invest.</li>
<li><strong>Crowding out.</strong> If government bond yields rise significantly. It will make government bonds more attractive and investors will lend government money, rather than lending to firms. This is known as financial <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1013/economics/crowding-out/">crowding out</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why did bond yields surge in September 2022?</h3>
<p>In the UK, Sept 2022, inflation was running at 10% and the economy at risk of recession. The government announced a huge fiscal expansion (involving tax cuts for high earners and an energy price guarantee) which saw the budget deficit soar.</p>
<figure id="attachment_170984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170984" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-170984 size-full" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ifs-Public-sector-borrowing.jpg" alt="ifs-Public-sector-borrowing" width="848" height="322" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ifs-Public-sector-borrowing.jpg 848w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ifs-Public-sector-borrowing-300x114.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ifs-Public-sector-borrowing-185x70.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ifs-Public-sector-borrowing-768x292.jpg 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ifs-Public-sector-borrowing-200x76.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ifs-Public-sector-borrowing-500x190.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-170984" class="wp-caption-text">Source: IFS</figcaption></figure>
<p>The IFS believed the budget meant the UK debt was on an unsustainable path. Also the fiscal expansion alone was likely to raise inflation. Markets saw UK debt as riskier and investors sold on expectations of higher inflation, higher interest rates.

<h3>2011/12 &#8211; Why UK bond Yields fell and Italy bonds rose</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11367" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eu-bond-yields-600x444.png" alt="eu-bond-yields" width="600" height="444" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eu-bond-yields-600x444.png 600w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eu-bond-yields-200x148.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eu-bond-yields-500x370.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eu-bond-yields-185x137.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eu-bond-yields-300x222.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eu-bond-yields.png 1057w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 2010-12, in some Eurozone economies, bond yields rose very rapidly because of fears over government debt. The UK had very high annual borrowing (2011/12 annual deficit &#8211; nearly 10% of GDP). Yet in the UK , bond yields have fell. This was because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase in savings rates in the UK. Higher private sector savings have increased demand for secure assets such as government bonds</li>
<li>Poor returns in the private sector. The double dip recession made investing in the private sector less attractive. Investors would rather have the security of government bonds with low-interest rates than riskier shares and private sector investment.</li>
<li>Quantitative Easing. The policy of Q.E. and the purchase of government bonds by the Bank of England has helped keep bond yields low.</li>
<li>A big reason UK yields were low is that they were not in the Eurozone, but have their own currency and can create more money if necessary. There are no fears of a liquidity crisis in the UK because the Bank of England can always print money if necessary.</li>
<li>Until 2012, Eurozone economies didn&#8217;t have a Central Bank willing to do this &#8211; so have been more susceptible to investor concerns.</li>

<h3>History of UK bonds since 1984</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171011" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web.png" alt="10-year-gilts-85-22-web" width="800" height="532" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web.png 800w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-300x200.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-185x123.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-768x511.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-200x133.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-500x333.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This shows the bond yield on 10-year government bonds since 1993.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Higher bond yields in the early 1990s were a reflection of higher inflation rates. Investors needed a higher yield to compensate for inflation eroding the value of savings. As inflation and interest rates fell in the 1990s and 2000s, so did bond yields.</p>
<h3>Importance of bond yields</h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everyone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; James Carville, Bill Clinton campaign strategist</p>
<p>The bond market is often quite quiet and not much happening, but sometimes the bond market can destabilise a government and force it to change its policy.</p>
<h3>Examples of when the Bond market changed government policy</h3>
<p><strong>The austerity of 2011.</strong> After the great financial crisis of 2008/09, European economies went into recession. Budget deficits rose and investors started to see southern European bonds as risky. In the Euro (at that time) the ECB was unwilling to intervene and provide liquidity for individual countries. Therefore, bond yields surged in countries like Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal. As a result, there was pressure on these countries to reduce government spending, and reduce budget deficits to (partly appease the bond market) This led to a deeper recession. The crisis ended in 2012 when new ECB chief Mario Draghi promised to buy bonds and &#8216;do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>The <em>fear</em> of the bond market was one rationale for UK austerity under Cameron and Osborne. Other economists argue the fear was misplaced because in a time of low inflation, markets were quite relaxed about government borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>UK mini-budget of September 2022</strong>. As well as an energy price guarantee, the government introduced £45 billion of unfunded tax cuts at a time of high inflation. Markets were spooked because the rise in debt was very large and they had no confidence it was sustainable in the long-term. (<a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/171028/economics/the-uks-self-imposed-economic-crisis-explained/">more detail here</a>). It led to a sell-off of gilts (bonds), and rising interest rates and the government were forced to u-turn on cutting the 45p tax rate and more pressure to cut spending. The Bank of England also intervened buying £65bn worth of gilts.</p>
<p><strong>Carter / Reagan</strong>. In 1976, long-term bond yields were 8%. By the end of Carter&#8217;s administration, they had risen to 12% &#8211; meaning their value fell by a third.  Markets blamed Carter on failure to reduce government spending and inflation. High-interest rates and inflation were a factor in Carter losing the 1980 election. It lay a framework for the philosophy of cutting government spending. Though Reagan increased the budget deficit by tax cuts and higher military spending. NY Times &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/business/what-the-bond-market-wants-from-president-reagan.html" class="broken_link">What the bond market wants from President Reagan</a>&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Bond Yield Curves</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="800px-bond_yield_curve_09_02_2005" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/800px-bond_yield_curve_09_02_2005.jpg" alt="Bond Yield Curve" width="450" height="271" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These show the interest rates for bonds of different maturities. Usually, bond yields on short-term debt (1 year or less) are low. Bond yields on longer-term debt (20,30 years) are higher. This is to reflect increased risk and likelihood of inflation in the long-term.</p>
<h4>Spread on Bond Yields</h4>
<ul>
<li>The spread is the difference between the yield on a long-term bond and a short-term bond.</li>
<li>For example, if a 30-year bond pays 5.00% while a 1-year bond pays 3.55%, the spread is 1.45%.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In February 2022, western economies imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions were wide-ranging including banning exports of many goods to Russia, freezing Russian foreign reserves and recently the EU has proposed banning Russian oil exports.</p>
<p>In response, Russia has retaliated by cutting off gas supplies to Europe causing a sharp rise in prices. The Russian economy has seen a sharp drop in GDP and many industries have struggled without access to their usual supply chains. However, outperforming the most pessimistic forecasts, the Russian economy has avoided any imminent collapse with an economy buoyed by continued high oil prices. Europe on the other hand is also struggling with unusually high inflation, a cost of living crisis and a risk of an imminent recession. Yet, in the long-term, Europe is confident they can ride out the storm, but Russia&#8217;s increasing isolation, risks the economy suffering longer term irreparable damage.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Russia v Europe - Who is losing over economic sanctions?" width="840" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1REUEKMfQ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In July 2022, the IMF  forecast Russia&#8217;s economy will decline 6%  in 2022 (less steep than the original forecast of &#8211; 8.5% in April). For 2023,  the Russian economy is expected to decline 3.5%. The slightly better than expected performance is due to strong oil revenues.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Russia’s economy is estimated to have contracted during the second quarter by less than previously projected, with crude oil and non-energy exports holding up better than expected,” (<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/russia-doing-better-than-expected-despite-sanctions-imf/">Euroactiv</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/ae8c39ec-en/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/ae8c39ec-en">OECD</a> are more pessimistic, (Sep) survey suggests Russian growth will fall 4.5% in 2023.</p>
<p>However, Bloomberg recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-05/russia-risks-bigger-longer-sanctions-hit-internal-report-warns">reported</a> that an internal report suggests that despite optimistic propaganda Russian officials are concerned that the Russian economy could take years to bounce back from the impact of sanctions. In the worst case stress scenario, Russian GDP will fall to 11.9% lower than the 2021 level and not recover for over a decade.</p>

<h3>How have sanctions affected the Russian economy?</h3>
<p><strong>Transport blockade</strong>. Russia faces a near blockade in terms of transport to Europe and flights around the world (except for a few remaining allies). For example, even former Soviet country Kazakhstan has started to crack down on a loophole which allowed Russian and Belorussian lorry drivers to bring goods from the EU.

<p><strong>Brain drain.</strong> The Russian internal report estimated that as many as 200,000 IT specialists may leave the country by 2025, reducing human capital, a key part of potential Russian growth.</p>

<p>A study by Yale university in August estimated half a million Russians had already left, many of which were highly educated and high net worth.</p>
<p><strong>More problems</strong></p>
<p>The partial mobilisation of Russian men in September has only encouraged more Russian to leave Russia. An estimated <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/putins-mobilization-will-further-upend-the-russian-economy/">360,000 Russians</a> have left to various neighbouring countries as there is deep unease at the prospect of conscription. The loss of young adults will be particularly felt by a Russian economy already experiencing a demographic shock, with an ageing population and a falling birth rate (1.50 Russian birth rate).</p>
<p><strong>Diminished access to western technologies.</strong> Sanctions on exports to Russia have been quite effective, leaving the Russian industry short of key components, such as microchips and ball-bearings. This damages long-term growth, and whilst firms can to some extent source alternatives or make do with simpler products, it will lead to lower growth potential in the long-term. It was hoped that Chinese exports would replace western exports, but in some technology, China is not ready. There is also evidence that Chinese firms themselves are reluctant to export to Russia for fear of western sanctions.</p>
<p>A good example, of the importance of western technology, is that it is critical in building liquefied natural gas plants. If Russia is to pivot from exporting to Europe by pipeline to LNG exports, it needs this western technology, and without it there will be significant delays.</p>
<p><strong>War stimulus?</strong></p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that when the US had entered wars, such as Second World War, Korea, Vietnam, it caused a surge in demand and production leading to high economic growth? Is there any chance the Russian economy could benefit from this? <a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-1dbjc4n r-1loqt21 r-1wbh5a2 r-dnmrzs r-1ny4l3l" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/IlyaMatveev_"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 css-1hf3ou5 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Ilya Matveev</span></span></a> a Russian political scientists says this is unlikely to happen for a few reasons. Russian manufacturing is weak due to capital and political investment in fossil fuels. Russian industry suffers from widespread corruption, which sees investment funds and profits diverted. Lack of key components that can&#8217;t be imported means industry is struggling to produce. The loss of basic manpower as Russians leave the economy is hampering productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Playing with fire</strong></p>
<p>Russian retaliation to EU and US sanctions has been to cut off gas flows to Europe. A full cut-off to Europe, Russia&#8217;s main export market would cost $6.6 a year in lost tax revenues, which can&#8217;t easily be compensated by growth elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Capital outflows</strong></p>

<h3>Global growth</h3>
<p>The war has hit global growth. In 2021, growth was 6% but now is expected to be only 2.25%, rather than the 3% predicted before the war.</p>
<p>This shows a fall in business and consumer confidence. The problem for Russia is that if the world does slow down or a few major economies go into recession, the price of oil could fall precipitously. For example, look at oil prices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171062" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web.png" alt="oil-prices-2003-2022-web" width="900" height="619" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-300x206.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-185x127.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-768x528.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-200x138.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/oil-prices-2003-2022-web-500x344.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>In 2008, oil prices reached a peak of $145, then in a great financial crisis plummeted to under $40. Such a reoccurrence would severely damage Russian GDP and Tax revenues (almost 50% of Russian tax revenues come from energy sector)</p>
<p><strong>Problems facing Russia</strong></p>
<p>An OECD report from Sept 2023 suggested Germany is likely to go into recession in 2023,  despite their expensive efforts to cap the price of gas. Germany is likely to go into recession because of the size of its industry and relative dependence on gas imports.</p>
<p>Germany is preparing to borrow $200bn to cap the price of gas and the EU is proposing an EU wide price cap. However, the concern is that a price cap may backfire, causing supplies to go elsewhere in the world. Also, a price cap may prevent demand from rising and therefore lead to shortages. Such a shortage would be very damaging for EU economy and could break up EU wide unity.</p>
<h3>Gas and electricity prices</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171059" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gas-electric-prices-oecd-web.png" alt="gas-electric-prices-oecd-web" width="900" height="456" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gas-electric-prices-oecd-web.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gas-electric-prices-oecd-web-300x152.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gas-electric-prices-oecd-web-185x94.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gas-electric-prices-oecd-web-768x389.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gas-electric-prices-oecd-web-200x101.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gas-electric-prices-oecd-web-500x253.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>European gas and electricity prices surged in the early summer months to a record level. However, since the tide of the war started to shift against Russia in summer, prices have fallen down. However, whilst that is welcome news for European consumers, they are still 600% above levels seen in early 2021. Wholesale energy prices</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171061" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web.png" alt="rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web.png 800w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web-300x169.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web-185x104.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web-768x432.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web-200x113.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rus-average-montnly-elect-prices-eu-web-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to underestimate how significant these prices are.</p>
<p>For example, Italy is spending 13% of its GDP on energy compare to 5% in 2019/21. Germany has risen from 3.8% to 9.2%. UK more than doubled 3.7% to 8.0%. Also, long-term weather forecasts for this winter are predicting a cold winter, which will push up gas demand.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171058" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/inflation-embedded.png" alt="inflation-embedded" width="900" height="527" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/inflation-embedded.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/inflation-embedded-300x176.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/inflation-embedded-185x108.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/inflation-embedded-768x450.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/inflation-embedded-200x117.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/inflation-embedded-500x293.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>However, it is not just energy prices that are rising. Higher price rises are becoming entrenched in a range of goods. This is because energy affects many aspects of the economy. For example, more expensive gas increases the cost of making fertiliser which increases food prices. But also inflation itself is becoming entrenched with firms pushing up prices where they can.</p>
<h3>Impact of gas shortages</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/ae8c39ec-en/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/ae8c39ec-en">OECD</a> model that a temporary period of enforced reductions in business gas usage in early 2023, would cause a 3% decline in potential output in all EU economies, pushing many countries into full-year recession in 2023.</p>
<h3>Oil sanctions</h3>
<p>Currently, the EU imports 2 million barrels per day of Russian crude and refined oil exports. However, later in the year once EU sanctions on seaborne oil supplies and maritime insurance from Russia take effect, that will lead to a fall in global supply, equal to 2% of global supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday 23 September Kwasi Kwarteng the new chancellor introduced a set of tax cuts and energy price guarantees in a measure the treasury described as a &#8216;fiscal event.&#8217; Yet even as he was reading out his series of unprecedented tax cuts (as share of GDP, 2nd biggest on record), markets took fright, causing the Pound to plummet and gilt yields to rise.</p>

<p>It was the biggest sell-off of government bonds for decades, breaking 15 years of quiet markets. Just a few days later the Bank of England was forced to intervene using Quantitative Easing to buy government bonds and prevent a rout on the market. Normally sober analysts like the IMF issued rare criticism of G7 governments</p>
<blockquote><p>“Given elevated inflation pressures in many countries, including the UK, we do not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Former US Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers declared the budget as “utterly irresponsible” and that &#8220;The U.K. is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market.&#8221; Some City traders were even less prosaic arguing the Conservative party had turned itself into a &#8220;Doomsday Cult&#8221; oblivious to reality and pursuing &#8220;fantasy economics.&#8217;</p>
<p>How do things unravel so quickly, so badly? How to explain what is going on?</p>
<h3>UK weakness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the UK economy has been doing relatively badly since the great financial crisis. Growth and productivity have been low. Lower than many of our competitors and well below post-war trend rate.</li>
<li>The Pound has been in steady decline for many years. But since June 2021, had already fallen by around 20% against the dollar and 6% against the Euro.</li>
<li>Debt has increased since 2007 due to low growth, Covid and is expected to grow because of demographic trends pushing.</li>
<li>Inflation. Rising energy prices have pushed up inflation to levels not seen since the early 1990s. Also, it is in danger of becoming more embedded in the economy, despite nominal wages falling behind inflation.</li>
<li>Current account deficit. The UK has seen an increase in current account deficit (despite Pound&#8217;s depreciation) and this winter it is expected to worsen as the cost of gas and oil imports rises.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171011" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web.png" alt="10-year-gilts-85-22-web" width="800" height="532" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web.png 800w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-300x200.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-185x123.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-768x511.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-200x133.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-85-22-web-500x333.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite this long-term trends, the bond market has been very quiet. Bond yields were around 2%, still very low by historical standards. Bond issues by the government have been heavily over-subscribed showing strong demand for UK bonds. The Bank of England had even begun quantitative tightening &#8211; selling off the bonds it bought in the last recession.</p>
<h3>What explains the market reaction?</h3>
<p><strong>The budget worsened inflation</strong>. Providing a massive fiscal boost of tax cuts, increases inflationary pressures &#8211; at a time when inflation is already a problem. Higher inflation causes the Pound to depreciate more (UK goods are less attractive). Also, higher inflation reduces the value of real bonds so investors need higher interest rates to compensate.</p>
<p><strong>The budget put upward pressure on interest rates.</strong> The market reaction to the budget is that the Bank of England will need to increase interest rates</p>
<ul>
<li>To keep inflation closer to its target of 2%</li>
<li>To prop up the falling Pound. (Higher rates make it more attractive to save in UK)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The unexpected cut in top rate of income tax</strong>. A curious feature of the market reaction was that most of the budget was announced in advance. But, Kwasi Kwarteng surprised markets with the abolition of the top rate of income tax of 45% on high earners. On its own, these tax cuts only lose the government around £2.5bn. But, it was symbolic that this government is ideological and willing to pursue unpopular measures and not caring about costing tax cuts. City traders are exactly the kind of people who will benefit from tax cuts and ending limits on banker&#8217;s bonuses. So why the adverse reaction?</p>
<p>They see the budget as politically unsustainable. Why cut taxes for high earners when low-income and middle-income households are worse off &#8211; despite the energy price guarantee?</p>
<p><strong>The budget doubled government borrowing with no plan to reduce it</strong></p>

<p>The budget will increase annual government borrowing from around £99bn to £190bn. But, the government did not let the OBR give any assessments of a sustainable path to reducing the deficit and national debt.</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy economics</strong></p>
<p>One city insider argued that the rise in UK gilt yields was due to a &#8216;moron premium&#8217; not very economic language. But, the point is the government&#8217;s plan for paying back debt through a miraculous increase in growth rates was based on wishful thinking, ideology and not any economic reality. The theory you can boost economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation has a certain political appeal. Exponents have included the great Milton Friedman. But, in reality, there is no shortcut to improving growth. (see limits of <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/174/economics/trickle-down-economics/">trickle-down economics</a>). City traders probably like tax cuts, but if they have to put their money where the mouth is, they know these tax cuts are not going to improve the UK&#8217;s long-term growth prospects.  So we have this big increase in debt, but no real hope that economic growth rates will improve to pay it off.</p>
<p><strong>The arrogance of Chancellor and PM</strong></p>
<p>It is not often personality plays such a key role in economics. But, with regard to market reaction, what people say does matter. Both Truss and Kwateng come with a proud reputation of doing unpopular things and not &#8216;listening to experts.&#8217; The first action of Kwasi Kwarteng was to sack, the well-respected independent civil servant Sir Tom Scholar, who Kwarteng claimed was too wedded to &#8216;Treasury orthodoxy &#8211; i.e. having a credible plan to reduce debt. After the market rout on Friday, Kwarteng announced the next day, he would have more unfunded tax cuts in March. It is said on Friday night when asked about the falling Pound, he is alleged to have said &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, it will come back.&#8221; Whether he said it or not is irrelevant. After a week of crisis, both PM and chancellor appeared reluctant to come out and defend their decisions preferring to blame &#8216;over-reaction&#8217; from the markets. The problem is markets do weigh very carefully the words, sentiment and actions of the chancellor and PM. And they don&#8217;t like, don&#8217;t trust their ability to pursue a sensible correction in policy which would reassure markets.</p>
<p>When Liz Truss went on local radio interviews on Thursday her answers offered little comfort to markets. It seems they slowly realising they need to change and have started to meet with the OBR, presumably to find spending cuts.</p>
<p><strong>Bank of England intervention</strong></p>
<p>The Bank of England has announced a £65bn intervention to buy long-term bonds. It was motivated by concerns pension funds were being wiped out by the rapid fall in bond prices. Ironically, Truss had wanted the Bank of England to end QE and pursue the tighter monetary policy. This is actually a return to QE though for the specific purpose of financial stability rather than monetary stimulus. Having a buyer of last resort is a very powerful way to calm markets and it will government more breathing time. However, this policy has its limits creating more money to buy bonds will not help Sterling, especially at a time of high inflation.</p>
<h3>Are there mitigating factors?</h3>
<p>Very few have been willing to come out and defend the actions of the government. Rather humorously, some have tried to claim the market reaction was a sudden concern about the inevitable arrival of a Labour government in 2 years&#8217; time.</p>
<p>US monetary policy. A stronger case is that the UK government&#8217;s position has been made worse by strength of dollar and rise in US interest rates. However, the crisis is entirely of the UK&#8217;s making. The Pound also fell against the Euro, even though the Eurozone has the same issues with strong Pound.</p>

<p><strong>Higher interest rates</strong>. Markets have forecast interest rates to rise from 2% to 6%. This will significantly increase the cost of mortgage repayments and could cause a crash in house prices.</p>
<p><strong>Majority of households are still worse off after budget</strong>. Tax cuts targetted at high earners, who are better off. But, many on low and middle incomes will still face a cost of living crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Spending cuts</strong>. To appease markets and restore fiscal credibility, the government are expressing a preference for spending cuts rather than reversing tax cuts. Spending cuts would be very damaging given many departments are already threadbare and the NHS facing long waiting lists. Really, the long-term constraints to the UK economy come from education and health care (rise in long-term sick). This will worsen long-term growth.</p>
<p><strong>Permanently higher bond yields</strong>. In recent years, the UK government has been able to borrow at exceptionally low interest rates. If the UK now faces higher debt yields because of the perceived risk premium, it will increase debt interest payments and create an opportunity cost of lower spending.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170991" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow.png" alt="pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow" width="900" height="586" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow-300x195.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow-185x120.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow-768x500.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow-200x130.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pound-dollar-2022-26-sept-arrow-500x326.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p><strong>Weak Pound.</strong> The crisis has only intensified the pressures on Sterling and it could easily push the Pound below parity of £1 to $1. This will increase future inflationary pressures and reduce living standards for UK households.</p>
<p><strong>Recession imminent</strong>. Despite the fiscal boost, it has been poorly targeted on high-income earners, who are more likely to save it. Overall, the fiscal boost is likely to be offset by higher interest rates, rising energy prices (still going up 25% despite the expensive price cap), falling house prices, low confidence and falling real wages. A recession would only give the government worse trade-off with more limited room for manoeuvre.</p>

<p>In the UK, even a small change in interest rates can have a significant impact on demand and economic growth. Higher rates increase the cost of borrowing, and in particular the cost of mortgages. Many households with loans or mortgages will have to pay more on monthly repayments, squeezing their disposable income and reducing spending.</p>

<h3>Why would rising interest rates be particularly damaging at the moment?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-170498" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios-1000x667.png" alt="uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios-1000x667.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios-300x200.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios-185x123.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios-768x512.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios-200x133.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios-500x333.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uk-house-price-to-earnings-ratios.png 1287w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>A sharp break with the past 15 years</strong>. Homeowners have become used to ultra-low interest rates. When interest rates are 0.5% for over a decade, households and firms make decisions based on interest rates staying low. People have taken out large mortgages and based the affordability of repayments on low rates. If interest rates rise from 0.5% to 6%.</p>
<p>A £270,ooo, 25-year mortgage.</p>
<ul>
<li>At 2% interest rate &#8211; average monthly repayments £1,144</li>
<li>At 6% interest rate &#8211; average monthly repayment £1,740</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone is on a variable mortgage. Many are on 2 year fixed with will expire over the next 18 months. For many households, a £600 increase in monthly payments will come as a shock and could lead to a catastrophic decline in disposable income. Analysts worry that such a mortgage shock will cause a significant fall in house prices as repossession rates rise and investors seek to offload high mortgage properties.</p>
<p>Also housing analysts argue that rising mortage costs would put pressure on landlords to increase rents, so it wouldn&#8217;t just be those with mortgages affected.</p>
<p>In one sense interest rates of 6% is not high by historical standards, but above inflation house price rises, mean that we are more sensitive to interest rate rises than ever before.</p>

<p>Adjusted for affordability, it will push rates up to those seen before the 2007 crisis and not that far off the 1990 house price crash.</p>
<h3>House price falls cause recession</h3>
<p>Whilst house prices are overvalued, expensive and causing difficulties for many first-time buyers. A sharp fall in house prices would destabilise the economy and likely push the economy into recession. Every big house price fall in recent decades has caused a recession because it is such an important metric for the UK economy. It is the biggest form of household wealth, and pushing homeowners into negative equity would reduce their ability to take part in equity withdrawal, and also significantly reduce consumer confidence. A combination of high inflation, falling real wages and higher interest rates would seriously put people under pressure to reduce spending.</p>
<h3>Rising bond yields</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171012" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-1.png" alt="10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web" width="800" height="543" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-1.png 800w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-1-300x204.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-1-185x126.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-1-768x521.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-1-200x136.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-1-500x339.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Before the rise in bond yields, the OBR expected UK debt interest payments to be in the region of £83bn or 2.5% of GDP. This is government spending that goes to holders of bond yields.</p>
<p>In April 2022, UK public sector net debt was  <strong>£2,347.7 billion </strong>or around <strong>95.7%</strong> of GDP)</p>
<ul>
<li>With average bond yields of around 3.75%  the annual interest payment would be £88bn.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2023, if we have a £200bn increase in debt to £2,547 bn and average bond yields rise to 5%</p>
<ul>
<li>With average bond yields of 5%, the annual interest payment would be £127bn.</li>
</ul>
<p>That would be an extra £40bn just on interest payments from average bond yields rising from 3.75 to 5%. Not This is not an exact forecast as we don&#8217;t know what will happen to bond yields, it just indicates how rising interest rates can eat into the government&#8217;s budget.</p>
<p>(I saw one forecast by Pantheon Macroeconomics that suggested that the UK’s debt interest bill would rise to £118 bn for the current financial year alone, but that was before bond yield surge. I would be very interested in OBR&#8217;s forecasts. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Sir Charlie Bean &#8211; ex Bank of England chief economist</span> told Channel 4 27 Sep, the bond yield rises since Friday will cost £20bn. A fifth of the education budget, 100% of the home office budget.)</p>
<h3>Concern of permanently higher bond yields</h3>
<p>The concern is that the loss of the UK&#8217;s reputation for low inflation and fiscal sustainability could lead to a permanently higher bond yield, like for example Italy in the 1980s. (Some analysts have called it the moron risk premium). Even if bond yields are slightly higher due to a decline in reputation, it will cost the UK government a fortune in debt interest payments. And there is a clear opportunity cost, if we spend more on interest payments, it is less to spend on health care, and education.</p>
<h3>Spending cuts</h3>
<p>One impact of large-scale tax cuts is that it will increase pressure on future governments to cut spending. In a recent editorial, the FT argued that if markets don&#8217;t readjust, the government should cut spending by £35bn. Even if a future government wanted to spend more (as they usually do) the legacy of higher debt interest payments would make it harder to finance ambitious spending schemes. For many years economists have been suggesting that with bond yields close to zero, governments should take advantage and increase public investment &#8211; even with borrowing. But, now there is high inflation and rising bond yields, this dynamic changed.</p>
<h3>Unequal effect</h3>
<p>The problem with interest rates is that there is an unequal effect. It is not the perfect policy instrument. Young people with loans and mortgages will be very hard hit financially. Older people who have paid off their mortgage will not be affected. The problem is that to achieve the desired result of protecting the Pound and reducing inflation, there are also equity issues with a particular cohort of younger people being more affected by the rising interest rates.</p>
<h3>Interest rates not what the economy needs</h3>
<p>An important feature about this interest rate rise, is that the Bank of England will raise rates reluctantly because the economic outlook is still quite grim, with businesses and households facing rising costs. Higher interest rates on top of this could create real problems for businesses and households. However, the interest rate increases is partly been driven by the need to shore up Sterling in the light of markets turning against UK assets. Also, it is a curious situation when the economy is been driven with the foot on the fiscal accelerator, but another foot on the monetary brake. It sends confusing signals to the economy and makes it harder to predict the outcome. Because of rising interest rates and lack of confidence, tax cuts received by firms and high-income households will likely save a high proportion of extra income, reducing point of fiscal expansion.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>There will be some people who benefit from increasing interest rates. Notably savers, who might legitimately claim real interest rates have been negative for too long, meaning their savings have declined in value (inflation higher than interest rates). Rising rates will be good for those who savings, and will increase their disposable income.</p>

<p><strong>In Summary</strong> A falling Pound makes:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK imports become more expensive and UK exports more competitive.</li>
<li>A falling Pound tends to cause higher inflation, but could cause a boost to short-term economic growth through higher exports.</li>
<li>A falling Pound <em>might</em> improve the current account as it boosts exports relative to imports</li>
<li>However, a falling Pound may be indicative of a very weak economy that markets are pessimistic about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs of fall in Pound</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171001" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/costs-fall-in-sterling.jpg" alt="costs-fall-in-sterling" width="933" height="362" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/costs-fall-in-sterling.jpg 933w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/costs-fall-in-sterling-300x116.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/costs-fall-in-sterling-185x72.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/costs-fall-in-sterling-768x298.jpg 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/costs-fall-in-sterling-200x78.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/costs-fall-in-sterling-500x194.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" /></p>
<h3>1. More expensive Imports</h3>
<p>As the value of Sterling falls, UK consumers need to use more Pound Sterling to buy the same amount of foreign goods. Let us use an example of an imported iPhone.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170999" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2021.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2021.jpg 700w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2021-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2021-185x104.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2021-200x113.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2021-500x281.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> A top-of-the-range iPhone costs in the region of $1,000. In May 2021, £1 was trading at $1.42, therefore, it cost a UK consumer £704.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170998" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2022.jpg" alt="Iphone devaluation" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2022.jpg 700w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2022-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2022-185x104.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2022-200x113.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-quick-video-card-iphone-2022-500x281.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
As of yesterday, the Pound had fallen 24% to £1 = $1.08. The cost of buying the same iPhone has now risen to £926. An increase of £222 (or 31%).</p>
<p>Clearly, this kind of decline in the value of the Pound is going to have a big impact on consumers, leaving less disposable income to buy other goods (though it may benefit local producers who become relatively more competitive. But, for many goods like iPhone, oil imports consumers don&#8217;t have any domestic options and it is difficult to substitute.</p>
<p><strong>2. Higher oil prices</strong></p>
<p>Because the UK is a net importer of oil and gas, a fall in the value of sterling has a big impact on the price of petrol and diesel. Oil and gas tend to be priced in $US so as the Pound falls (especially against the dollar), the price of petrol will rise as a result. This explains why US petrol prices have fallen nearly back to the pre-crisis level, whereas UK prices are much higher. The <a href="http://$1.35, instead of Friday’s $1.11, petrol pump prices would be at least 11p a litre cheaper or £6.05 for a 55-litre a tank." class="broken_link">AA notes</a> that if the Pound had kept its level of £1 to $1.35, petrol would be at least 11p cheaper or £6 a tank cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cost-push inflation</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170776" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow.png" alt="uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow" width="1000" height="690" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow-300x207.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow-185x128.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow-768x530.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow-200x138.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uk-inflation-08-22-aug-web-no-arrow-500x345.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Rising prices of imports contribute toward cost-push inflation. In 2008 and 2012, the spikes in inflation were also partly due to a weaker Pound, but they were temporary. The prolonged weakness of the Pound in 2021 and 2022 is causing a more serious rise in inflation (also of course, caused by rising oil prices), This rise in inflation can also cause higher inflation expectations and knock-on effects, e.g. price rises become embedded and put upward pressure on nominal wages. The rapid depreciation we are seeing is worsening the inflationary effect, and this can cause a negative spiral as rising inflation itself puts more downward pressure on Sterling.</p>
<p><strong>4. Pressure to raise interest rates</strong></p>
<p>If there is strong downward pressure on Sterling and the Bank of England feels this is becoming destabilising, they will increase interest rates to protect the value of Sterling (making it more attractive to save in UK). However, rising rates will increase UK debt interest rate costs, UK mortgages and loan rates, all causing downward pressure on demand. In this case, the Bank is raising interest rates because markets are concerned the recent budget is exacerbating inflation and causing an unsustainable rise in debt. But, it is probably raising interest rates reluctantly because of their impact on household finances.</p>
<h3>Benefits of falling Sterling</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171000" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-fall-in-sterling.jpg" alt="benefits-fall-in-sterling" width="932" height="240" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-fall-in-sterling.jpg 932w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-fall-in-sterling-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-fall-in-sterling-185x48.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-fall-in-sterling-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-fall-in-sterling-200x52.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-fall-in-sterling-500x129.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>More competitive exports </strong>As the Pound falls in value, it is good news for exporters, who will become more competitive in international markets. For example, whiskey firms who rely on export market to North America will be able to make bigger profit margins and/or undercut rivals to increase market share.</li>
<li><strong>Potential boost to domestic demand</strong>. A depreciation in currency encourages domestic consumption rather than imports and increases export demand. This can lead to a boost in economic growth. For example, in 1992, when the UK Pound was overvalued, leaving the ERM and the subsequent devaluation led to a strong economic recovery as export growth increased. (It was also helped by lower interest rates). However, in Sep 2022, this is unlikely to happen, any boost to growth from higher exports will be countered by rising inflation and rising interest rates.</li>
<li>Can help to reduce the trade deficit. A large trade deficit implies there is an imbalance of exports and imports, a depreciation can help reduce this as it makes domestic goods relatively more competitive.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-170357" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-1000x666.png" alt="current-account-00-22" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-1000x666.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-300x200.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-185x123.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-768x511.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-200x133.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-500x333.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22.png 1003w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>In 2022, the UK has a large current account deficit and a fall in the exchange rate will go some way to improve the current account.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, demand for exports and imports has proved quite inelastic and a fall in currency has often done little to improve the trade deficit. For example, the current account deficit has worsened in 2021 and 2022  &#8211; despite a weaker Pound.</p>
<p>For example, depreciation makes gas imports more expensive, but there is no alternative so as the price rises, the UK has to spend more on imports. The value of gas imports is predicted to rise from £1.8bn to £8bn this winter because of rising prices. This will actually worsen the current account, highlighting the importance of elasticity of demand to the effects of devaluation.</p>
<h3>Long term effects</h3>
<p>A short-term effect of a weaker Pound is that exporters get a boost in competitiveness, but how long does this improved competitiveness last?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170885" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pound-fall.png" alt="pound-fall" width="871" height="484" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pound-fall.png 871w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pound-fall-300x167.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pound-fall-185x103.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pound-fall-768x427.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pound-fall-200x111.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pound-fall-500x278.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" /></p>
<p>This shows the fall in the value of the Pound since the last century. It reflects the UK&#8217;s declining competitiveness and pre-eminence in global economics. It reflects the fact that the long-term decline in Sterling reflects the long-term decline in relative competitiveness. A weaker Pound can give a short-term boost, but a strong economy will see an appreciation in the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Also, a fall in the Pound may give a temporary boost to competitiveness but often causes inflationary pressure. It is not just from more expensive imports, but exporters may face less incentive to cut costs when they can rely on a weaker currency. This was the logic for fixed exchange rates &#8211; arguably it would increase the incentive to be competitive and not rely on the easy option of depreciation.</p>
<h3>Why is there a fall in the value of the Pound</h3>
<p>It is also very important to know why the Pound is falling. For example, when the UK left the gold standard in 1931, it helped the economy recover from Great Depression. When the <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/black-wednesday/">Pound left the ERM in 1992</a>, it led to a long period of rising growth in the <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/6901/economics/the-great-moderation/">great moderation</a>. You could say these were &#8216;good&#8217; devaluations because they moved Pound to a more competitive rate and avoided the need for high-interest rates and tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>The depreciation in the Pound we see in 2022 is very different, it reflects the fact that markets are concerned about</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation rising in the economy due to cost-push factors and tax cuts of mini budget</li>
<li>Government borrowing is set on an unsustainable path due to unfunded tax cuts.</li>
</ul>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170976" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web.png" alt="10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web" width="900" height="622" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-300x207.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-185x128.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-768x531.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-200x138.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10-year-gilts-daily-16-22-web-500x346.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniquely for such a large change of fiscal policy, the government didn&#8217;t want the OBR publishing an independent forecast for the outcome of public finances, presumably because they will be so dire.</p>
<p>Former US Treasury secretary <span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc"> Lawrence Summers</span></span> slammed the budget, arguing the Pound will likely fall below parity to the dollar.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It makes me very sorry to say, but I think the U.K. is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market,” (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-uk-is-behaving-a-bit-like-an-emerging-market-turning-itself-into-a-submerging-market-former-u-s-treasury-secretary-says-11663944639">Market Watch</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Usually, when governments announce big plans to increase borrowing, it leads to a rise in the value of the currency. This is because, higher borrowing, leads to higher interest rates, making the currency more attractive. However, the UK is experiencing the unwelcome combination of rising interest rates and a falling currency. This is indicative that markets are fearful of future UK economic growth, higher inflation and plans to deal with rising debt.</p>
<h4>Prospects for growth remain very weak</h4>
<p>Combining the energy bailout with permanent tax cuts will drive up borrowing by £411 billion in the coming years, but the nature of the borrowing will do little to increase economic growth.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170982" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget.png" alt="cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget" width="900" height="559" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget-300x186.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget-185x115.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget-768x477.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget-200x124.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cost-of-living-vs-effects-budget-500x311.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>This shows that for low (and middle) income groups the rising cost of essentials is greater than the increase in disposable income from budget. It is only the top 20% of income earners which are seeing a rise in income greater than costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the majority of households will not feel better off and continue to cut back spending.</p>
<p>By focusing tax cuts on high-income earners, the fiscal expansion is largely wasted. A lot of the tax cut will be saved.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170983" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ft-comment.png" alt="ft-comment" width="694" height="179" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ft-comment.png 694w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ft-comment-300x77.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ft-comment-185x48.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ft-comment-200x52.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ft-comment-500x129.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p>This comment is interesting as it highlights a perspective on personal wealth and public wealth. It is also interesting &#8216;An extra £5k in bank account&#8217;. That is also a key point, higher tax cuts for high-income earners are largely saved. (especially if you are pessimistic about the future)</p>
<p>Also, the expansionary effect of tax cuts will to a large extent be offset by higher interest rates. Markets are now pricing in interest rates of 5.5% or more &#8211; which will reduce demand, especially for the younger workers with large mortgages.</p>
<p>Some people talk about a &#8216;barber boom&#8217; and an inflationary rise in demand, but despite the large rise in borrowing, the impact on demand may prove quite limited because there are so many conflicting pressures in the economy. As some observers have mentioned, it is like the UK is driving a car with one foot on the (fiscal) accelerator and one foot on the (monetary) brake.</p>
<h3>Impact on long-term growth</h3>
<p>More seriously is the issue of whether large tax cuts will cause a boost in economic growth and help make the borrowing more sustainable. Markets and most economists do not believe this to be the case. There is very limited productivity rises from cutting tax for high earners. There is no strong link between cutting corporation tax and prolonged higher levels of investment. (see: <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/13566/economics/the-effect-of-tax-cuts/">effect of tax cuts</a>)</p>
<p>The real challenge to UK stagnant growth is poor productivity, low investment, demographic factors and low global growth and this cannot easily be solved by tax cuts (or indeed any government policy).</p>
<p>A better policy would have been to use fiscal expansion on investing in green energy, insulating home and improving basic infrastructure. This would at least have the benefit of helping to reduce future energy crisis and reduce dependence on foreign imports of energy.</p>
<h3>Borrowing to Rise</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">Source <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/mini-budget-response">IFS &#8211; Mini Budget response</a></p>
<p>As a result of the budget, borrowing for 2022/23 will now be £190bn rather than £99bn (and it could be worse if government revise spending upwards due to high inflation).</p>
<p>Importantly, even when the Energy Price Guarantee (EPF) expires, borrowing will be significantly higher because of tax cuts, rising interest payments. Also, there is no guarantee the energy price guarantee will not be more expensive if gas prices remain high.</p>
<h2>So will there be a debt crisis?</h2>
<p>Markets dislike the mini-budget because it is a serious deterioration of the UK&#8217;s position, big increases in borrowing, but no long-term benefit and real concerns about the future of inflation. Markets are currently expecting debt to grow on an unsustainable path, which will lead to the necessity of politically unpopular future tax rises, and spending cuts. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean (at least in foreseeable future) the UK will face a debt crisis as we see in emerging economies, such as Argentina. This is for a number of reasons.</p>
<p><strong>1. Lender of Last Resort</strong>. The Bank of England acts as a lender of last resort to the government. If the gov&#8217;t could sell bonds, the Bank of England would buy, creating money if necessary. This helps to reduce liquidity issues, which plagued Euro countries in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>2. Bond yields still low by historical standards</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170977" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web.png" alt="uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web" width="900" height="620" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web.png 900w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web-300x207.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web-185x127.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web-768x529.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web-200x138.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/uk-10-year-gilt-93-22-web-500x344.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the early 1990s, 10 year gilt yields were in double figures. Gilt yields are on the way up (heading above 4% this morning), but they are still low by historical standards.</p>
<p><strong>3. Debt maturity</strong>. The average debt maturity for UK gilts is 13 years. This is a long-time to maturity. This reduces the likelihood of an imminent crunch.</p>
<p><strong>4. Global savings glut</strong>. One reason for low-interest rates in the past 15 years is a glut of global savings. This has led to relatively low global growth, but also strong demand for bonds. Although UK bonds are becoming less attractive than US bonds, there still is strong demand for sovereign debt, which will still be of some benefit to the UK, even if gilt yields need to be a little higher. Recently in August, there was still strong demand for UK Gilt sales, with bond issues 2.5 times oversubscribed.</p>
<p><strong>5. UK external liabilities mostly denominated in Sterling</strong>. Most of UK&#8217;s net liabilities are denominated in Sterling, so a depreciation improves UK&#8217;s net investment position. This means a fall in the Pound does not cause a self-reinforcing cycle of deterioration in assets. (and therefore avoid currency crisis) Paul Krugman argued UK&#8217;s recent budget was terrible (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/opinion/uk-truss-tax-cut-economy.html" class="broken_link">Tax cut zombies attack UK / NY Times paywall</a>), he didn&#8217;t see a <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1573649995290628096">currency crisis in UK</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. Debt still not high by historical standards</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170424" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines.png" alt="uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines" width="1000" height="595" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines-300x179.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines-185x110.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines-768x457.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines-200x119.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/uk-national-debt-since-1727-lines-500x298.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Whilst debt to GDP will rise to over 100% of GDP quite quickly. (and this is a rare occurrence for peacetime. The UK has had higher levels of debt in the past.</p>
<h3>But &#8211; why growing debt does matter</h3>
<p><strong>1. Monetisation of debt is not possible with inflation over 10%</strong>. In the past 15 years, economists (especially of an <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/162341/economics/modern-monetary-theory-mmt-explained/">MMT</a> persuasion) state &#8211; that you can&#8217;t default when you have your own currency and issue debt in your own currency. However, this does have a limitation, if inflation is running at 10%, you can&#8217;t print money without causing a real inflationary problem. Already the Bank of England has begun quantitative tightening, selling bonds on the market, which increase interest rates.</p>
<p>In the Napoleonic War and First World War, the high UK debt did cause considerable inflation, which causes a &#8216;hidden default&#8217; default through inflation. The government reduces the debt burden by reducing the real value of money and savings.</p>
<p><strong>2. The inflationary impact of borrowing</strong>. The fiscal expansion is so big, it increases the potential for inflation, which will put more downward pressure on the Sterling and the need for compensating interest rate rises.</p>
<p><strong>3. Level of debt is not everything</strong>. The UK required a <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/132993/economics/uk-imf-crisis-of-1976/">bailout in the 1970s from the IMF. </a>This was not just due to high borrowing, but also large current account deficit and sliding Sterling at a time when the government wished to target the exchange rate.</p>
<p><strong>4. UK twin deficits</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-170357" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-1000x666.png" alt="current-account-00-22" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-1000x666.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-300x200.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-185x123.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-768x511.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-200x133.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22-500x333.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/current-account-00-22.png 1003w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>UK has a twin deficit with a current account deficit expected to rise this winter because of a rise in the value of energy imports this winter.</p>
<p>Demand for gas imports is very inelastic, so as their price rises, demand for other imports must fall driven by falling sterling and/or tighter monetary policy. The fiscal expansion keeps demand for imports up &#8211; putting more downward pressure on Sterling.</p>
<h3>You don&#8217;t need a &#8216;Crisis&#8217; to be a serious problem.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just because we might not have an actual default and collapse in sterling, doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t a serious problem.</li>
<li>The large rise in borrowing now (at a time of high inflation) will constrain future governments&#8217; ability to spend.</li>
<li>Are we getting the best value out of borrowing? Are tax cuts for high earners and corporations best for long-term growth when it could have been spent on insulation, green energy and reducing the need for energy imports?</li>
<li>Despite the bailout there is still a risk of rising business failures because of rising interest rates and energy prices. An economic downturn this winter would worsen many of the government&#8217;s options.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Why has the Pound Sterling been falling?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Pound has been in long term decline since after the Second World War, when £1 = $4.05. In recent decades the pound has continued to decline. In particular since the great financial crash of 2007, which hit the UK hard. In recent years, the combination of Brexit, rising inflation and lack of confidence in the UK economy has pushed sterling lower &#8211; especially against the dollar.</p>

<h3>Reasons for the fall in the value of Pound post-Brexit June 2016</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>. Markets dislike the uncertainty over what will happen to UK politics, UK economy and the UK financial sector. The UK is not seen as a &#8216;safe haven&#8217;. Investors for looking for more certainty will prefer to save in US and Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Rise in borrowing at a time of high inflation</strong>. In the Sept &#8216;mini budget&#8217; the chancellor announced large fiscal stimulus, focused on tax cuts for companies, high earners and an energy bailout. The cost of the tax give aways is forecast to increase borrowing by over £400bn, causing the IFS to state &#8220;UK borrowing is on an unsustainable path&#8221; <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/170973/economics/will-surge-in-borrowing-cause-a-debt-crisis-in-the-uk/">Fall in Pound Sterling due to Brexit, Energy Crisis and Recession</a></li>
<li><strong>Less inward capital investment</strong>. Loss of Single Market. Since Brexit the UK has left the single market (to be able to restrict the free movement of people), which has discouraged much inward investment (see: levels of <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/21007/economics/uk-levels-of-foreign-direct-investment-fdi/">inward investment in UK)</a>. With less inward investment, there will be less long-term demand for sterling.</li>
<li><strong>Trade friction</strong>. Not only has the UK left the single market but also the EU customs union. This has meant UK exporters have faced increased costs of trade, leading to less demand for UK exports and Sterling.</li>
<li><strong>A predicted decline in portfolio investment.</strong> The City of London has been the dominant European trading centre, attracting many capital flows. Outside the EU and the single market, trading in the City of London is less attractive, causing the Pound to fall in value.</li>
<li><strong>Higher UK inflation than competitors</strong>. The UK is experiencing higher inflation than many of our competitors, making UK goods less attractive.</li>
</ul>

<p>One reason for this higher inflation, is the UK&#8217;s poor productivity performance in recent years. Stagnating productivity has led to lower economic growth and more inflationary pressures.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-159998 size-large aligncenter" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance-600x461.png" alt="uk-current-account-balance" width="600" height="461" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance-600x461.png 600w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance-300x230.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance-185x142.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance-768x590.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance-200x154.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance-500x384.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uk-current-account-balance.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current account deficit</strong>. Since 2016, the UK has a high current account deficit as a % of GDP &#8211; up to 7% of GDP (see current account. This current account deficit has been financed by capital flows, but if these dry up, the Pound will have to fall to correct the imbalance in trade.</li>
<li><strong>Rising energy imports</strong>. A difficulty the UK faces is that the rising price of gas and oil have pushed up the cost of imports. Demand is inelastic meaning higher prices cause rise in import spending.</li>

<hr />
<h3>General reasons for a decline in the value of Pound Sterling could include:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If Recession is forecast in UK. </strong>A recession means interest rates will stay low and more possible monetary easing<strong>. </strong>Lower interest rates make the UK a less attractive place to invest hot money flows (get a better return elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>House price fall. </strong>A significant fall in house prices increase the likelihood of persistently low interest rates. See: <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/170708/economics/are-we-set-for-a-housing-market-crash/">Are we set for a housing market crash?</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance of Payments. </strong>A current account deficit (value of exports less than imports) leads to an outflow of foreign currency, putting downward pressure on sterling. This is important since drying up of capital flows due to lower interest rates and global credit crunch</li>
<li><strong>Strength of the Euro / dollar.</strong> If the Euro or Dollar becomes very strong, e.g. because of good economic news, the Pound will fall relative to these currencies.</li>
<li><strong>Quantitative Easing</strong>. The Bank of England&#8217;s policy to create money electronically, increases the monetary base. This increases the risk of future inflation in UK and so tends to reduce the value of the Pound.</li>
<li><strong>Long term purchasing power parity</strong>. If UK goods become relatively more expensive compared to other goods, then there will be a gradual decline in demand for UK exports, putting downward pressure on the Pound.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Euro or Euros &#8211; What is the plural of Euros?</h3>
<p>A falling pound impacts on our exporters, the price of importers and future rate of economic growth. But, the most interesting thing about this post seems to be whether the plural of Euro is Euro or Euros.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going for euros. Because I Just like using it. But, it is also what the EU recommend for non-legal documents.</p>

The government&#8217;s proposed solutions are quite striking with one of the biggest interventions in the economy in recent years. Their main proposals are</p>
<ul>
<li>A price cap on energy (average of £2,500) requires the government paying the excess to energy companies. The cost is estimated at around £130bn.</li>
<li>Cut in corporation tax</li>
<li>Cut in income tax. Reversing NI raise</li>
<li>More deregulation and liberalisation of markets, such as abolishing stamp duty and making it harder for part-time to claim in-work benefits.</li>
<li>The main objective is &#8220;growth, growth&#8221; The <em>hope</em> is that by raising economic growth, the tax cuts pay for themselves through higher economic growth.</li>
<li>It is a bizarre mixture of Keynesian demand management and <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/174/economics/trickle-down-economics/">trickle-down economics</a>. Reminiscent not so much of Mrs Thatcher (who cut income tax, but raised VAT to reduce budget deficit) but Ronald Reagan who in the 1980s cut income tax aggressively (funded by borrowing)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems of Energy bailout</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-170668" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines-1000x636.png" alt="natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines" width="1000" height="636" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines-1000x636.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines-300x191.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines-185x118.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines-768x488.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines-200x127.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines-500x318.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natural-gas-prices-2006-22-lines.png 1222w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The headline intervention is the energy bailout, which will prevent catastrophic price increases due to rising gas prices this winter. The benefits of this are to avoid a further decline in living standards and prevent costs from becoming even more excessive for business. Also by limiting energy price rises, it will limit the rise inflation to 11% (rather than 13-18%).</p>
<p>It is a necessary intervention, something had to be done, even if imperfect, the main thing is to prevent a meltdown in living costs and forcing businesses to close from excessive energy prices. However, it still does raise some concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be financed by government borrowing. But debt is already rising and <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/170447/economics/why-uk-national-debt-could-surge/">set to soar</a> in coming decades, another £130bn (+) on top does raise very real risks about debt, especially with interest rates rising. In the absence of the OBR, the <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/reversing-nics-and-corporation-tax-rises-would-leave-debt-unsustainable-path">IFS state</a> gov&#8217;t proposals would put UK on an unsustainable path.</li>
<li>With inflation at 10%, there is no question of financing debt through QE like in 2009.</li>
<li>Ultimately taxpayers will pay for rising energy costs through lower government spending, and higher taxes in the future.</li>
<li>Should the government pay the whole cost of the energy bailout at a time when energy companies are making record profits? A windfall tax could not meet the whole bailout but spreading the cost would be fairer to the taxpayer.</li>
<li>There is a strong case for disconnecting the price of electricity from the most expensive input (at the moment gas.) Producers of renewable energy and nuclear are very profitable at moment.</li>
<li>There is no guarantee energy prices will come down in six months time. We could see very high energy prices into 2024. This could leave the government with the need to spend and borrow even more.</li>
<li>The bailout will go disproportionately to high-income earners because they use more energy. As Paul Johnson of the <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/liz-truss-cost-of-living-energy-bailout-price-cap-targeted/">Institute for Fiscal Studies said on R4</a> “the majority of the money will go to better off people who use more energy so this is very poorly targeted.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative solutions could have been more direct income support rather than capping prices. This would create more incentive to reduce demand (and prevent gas shortages) and target support to those who need it more.</p>
<p>I understand there is a logic that the energy price cap is at least simple and easy to understand and avoids some people slipping through net, but a side-effect of the chosen solution is that it will go disproportionately to high-income earners, which is a problem given tax cuts (and ending cap on bankers bonuses) will disproportionately benefit high earners too. Also, price caps discourage efforts to reduce demand, install solar panels e.t.c.</p>
<h4>Tax cuts</h4>
<p>The good news about tax cuts is that it will to some extent stave off a dramatic fall in aggregate demand and imminent recession (which recently the Bank of England predicted to be the worst in living memory). The bailout and tax cuts are a very large fiscal expansion, which will provide some boost to demand at a time of falling spending and weak growth.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-170777" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/real-wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs.png" alt="real--wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs" width="1000" height="622" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/real-wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/real-wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs-300x187.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/real-wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs-185x115.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/real-wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs-768x478.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/real-wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs-200x124.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/real-wage-growth-uk-18-22-web-signs-500x311.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The bad news is that they may not be enough. That might sound strange given the scope of extra borrowing. But, many households, will not actually see this energy bailout as a boost. Prices are still going to rise in October, at a time when the cost of living is already a real issue with real wages falling. Many people haven&#8217;t come to terms with the price rises from last April.</li>
<li>The latest tax cuts will have the largest impact on high earners and big companies. High earners will spend more as a result, but if fiscal expansion had been better targeted to those really struggling with the cost of living, it would have had a bigger impact on avoiding poverty and also boosting short-term growth because those on low incomes have a higher propensity to spend.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not convinced corporation tax cuts will boost investment. There is no evidence that lower rates of corporation tax guarantee higher investment, especially in the current climate of long-term weakness in investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-169087" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uk-business-investment-97-22.jpg" alt="" width="876" height="570" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uk-business-investment-97-22.jpg 876w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uk-business-investment-97-22-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uk-business-investment-97-22-185x120.jpg 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uk-business-investment-97-22-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uk-business-investment-97-22-200x130.jpg 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uk-business-investment-97-22-500x325.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>It is most likely that firms will continue to be cautious about large-scale investment, given higher interest rates, weak growth, global uncertainty and rising prices. (see <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/21345/economics/does-cutting-corporate-tax-rates-increase-revenue/">effect of tax cuts</a>)</li>
<li>A much better use of government borrowing would have been to fund investment directly. There is no shortage of possible investment projects, such as improving infrastructure, education, and health care. A really good use of public money would be to invest in insulating homes and factories so that we are in a better position to deal with high energy prices in the long-term.</li>
<li>Interest rate rises will also weigh down the economy because with high mortgage balances, small increases in interest rates will have a big effect in reducing affordability.</li>

<h3>Tax cuts pay for themselves</h3>
<p>A real area of concern is that the Conservative government appear unwilling to allow the OBR to publish forecasts for debt, and they talk of &#8216;tax cuts funding themselves and everything will be OK when tax cuts boost the rate of economic growth. This is what might politely be called &#8216;fantasy economics.&#8217;</p>
<p>It is true right-wing leaning economists like Greg Mankiw may claim a 1/3 of tax cuts end up paying for themselves with higher growth. But, a left-wing leaning economist like Paul Krugman is more unforgiving arguing the idea tax cuts pay for themselves is the ultimate &#8216;zombie&#8217; idea that no matter how many times it is disproved it doesn&#8217;t go away. (partly because it is so politically appealing) (More <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/13566/economics/the-effect-of-tax-cuts/">papers on this subject here</a>)</p>
<p>The problem is that with rising interest rates, the cost of servicing UK debt is going to rise significantly. One forecast suggests UK debt interest payments could surge to £118 bn for the current financial year alone, £35 billion higher than previously forecast (on the back of higher rates and higher interest rates).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-170321" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend-1000x665.png" alt="uk-productivity-2000-22-trend" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend-1000x665.png 1000w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend-300x200.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend-185x123.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend-768x511.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend-200x133.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend-500x333.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uk-productivity-2000-22-trend.png 1027w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>A real problem the UK economy faces is a <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5887/economics/uk-labour-productivity/">slowdown in productivity growth</a> since 2007, partly due to an unwillingness to invest by firms but also demographics, technological factors and weak demand. Tax cuts alone will not change this dynamic, especially given all the continued global uncertainty, higher costs, weak demand and issues relating to Brexit.</p>
<p><strong>Stamp Duty cut</strong></p>
<p>Stamp duty is a distortionary tax which discourages people from moving. In theory, there are advantages of abolishing stamp duty to encourage greater flexibility in the housing markets (e.g. make it easier for people to downsize or upsize). But, given the increasing wealth inequality in the UK, a cut in stamp duty needs to be part of a bigger package to address the huge wealth inequality (and intergenerational equality) which would be worsened by cutting stamp duty. Also stamp duty raises in the region of £17bn.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The government are right to take big action for this unprecedented challenge, some of which is out of its control. They do face a challenging economic climate with an unwelcome combination of inflation, recession, and rising energy prices. However, although this package does stave off the worst impact, there is a sense of a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>The faith in <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/174/economics/trickle-down-economics/">trickle-down economics</a> and tax cuts to revitalise the UK economy and create some kind of &#8216;economic miracle&#8217; is misplaced. It reminds me of the late 1980s, when chancellor Nigel Lawson talked about an &#8216;economic miracle&#8217; from the 1980s supply-side policies, allowing UK growth to increase to 4%+ &#8211; but this was just hubris and we ended up with a boom and bust (recession 1990/91).</p>
<p>Also, the energy crisis may not go away for quite a long time, the UK desperately needs to develop more renewable energy, insulate homes and businesses and wean itself off fossil fuels (for both economic and environmental reasons). If the government is going to borrow an extra £140bn + then there should be more targeted use of public money for these goals of renewable energy and better insulation.</p>
<p>Also, the distributional effects of the bailout are skewed towards the highest earners, both tax cuts and energy bailout will benefit higher earners significantly more. The government would get two significant benefits from more targetted help to low-income earners</p>
<ol>
<li>The poor have a higher marginal propensity to consume so expansionary fiscal policy and avoiding recession would be bigger.</li>
<li>It would tackle the real cost of living crisis and poverty many households will face over this winter.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trickle down economics is a term used to describe the belief that if high-income earners gain an increase in salary, then everyone in the economy will benefit as their increased income and wealth filter through to all sections in society.</p>
<h3>How the trickle-down effect may work in theory</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135741" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect.png" alt="trickle-down-effect" width="665" height="484" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect.png 665w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-200x146.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-500x364.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-185x135.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-300x218.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-600x437.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></a></p>
<p>If the richest gain an increase in wealth, then</p>
<ul>
<li>They will spend a proportion of this extra wealth.</li>
<li>The extra wealth will cause an increased demand for goods and services, causing higher employment and a rise in wages.</li>
<li>The higher wages will also cause a <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1948/economics/the-multiplier-effect/">multiplier effect</a>, e.g. if more chauffeurs are employed by the rich, the chauffeur will gain increased income and, in turn, they will increase spending in local businesses.</li>
<li>A cut in taxes increases the incentive to work. Lower income tax encourages people to work longer. Lower corporation tax encourages business to invest, creating wealth.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the wealthy may invest their increased wealth. If the wealth is invested in new businesses, it will create new jobs and increase the incomes of those employed.</li>
<li>Higher spending and investment will stimulate economic activity leading to a rise in tax revenues (higher income tax, higher VAT).</li>
<li>Higher tax revenues can fund public programmes such as healthcare, education and welfare payments to the poor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trickle-down effect and tax cuts</h3>
<p>An important element of the trickle-down effect is with regard to income tax cuts for the top-income earners. It is argued that cutting income tax for the rich will not just benefit high-earners, but also everyone. The argument is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If high-income earners see an increase in disposable income, they will increase their spending and this creates additional demand in the economy. This higher level of aggregate demand creates jobs and higher wages for all workers.</li>
<li>Alternatively, increased profits for firms may be reinvested into expanding output. This again leads to higher growth, wages and incomes for all.</li>
<li>Lower income taxes increase the incentive to for people to work leading to higher productivity and economic growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/140859/economics/the-laffer-curve/">The Laffer curve</a> suggests cutting tax can even cause an increase in tax revenues as the lower tax rates are offset by higher growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>A study by <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/jun97/tax-rate-cuts-would-raise-long-term-growth">NBER June 1997</a> Engen and Skinner conclude that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“cutting marginal tax rates across the board by 5 percentage points and cutting average tax rates by 2.5 percentage points would increase the growth rate of U.S. GDP by 0.3 percentage points per year.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Criticisms of trickle-down economics</h3>
<p>I have a joke about trickle-down economics. Only 99% of you will get it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135743" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism.png" alt="trickle-down-effect-criticism" width="781" height="469" srcset="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism.png 781w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism-200x120.png 200w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism-500x300.png 500w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism-185x111.png 185w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism-300x180.png 300w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism-768x461.png 768w, https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trickle-down-effect-criticism-600x360.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></a></p>
<p>Many economists are sceptical of the belief in &#8216;the trickle-down&#8217; effect. One reason, the wealthy have a higher marginal propensity to save, and also n recent years, wealth has been saved in off-shore accounts to avoid paying tax. Therefore, when the wealthy gain extra income, only a small percentage may filter through to low-income workers.</p>
<p>Also, some studies suggest that increased income inequality can lead to this inequality being solidified through educational opportunities, wealth accumulation and the growth of monopoly/monopsony power. Furthermore, increased inequality may lead to lower rates of economic growth.</p>
<p><i><strong>Tax cuts have no clear impact on growth. </strong>In <a class="external" href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope_economic_consequences_of_major_tax_cuts_published.pdf">The Economic Consequences of Major Tax Cuts for the Rich</a> (2020),</i> by David Hope and Julian Limberg, the authors found tax cuts for the rich, had no statistical effect on economic growth. They looked particularly at the 1980s in UK and US, where significant taxes were cut.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The results also show that economic performance, as measured by real GDP per capita and the unemployment rate, is not significantly affected by major tax cuts for the rich. The estimated effects for these variables are statistically indistinguishable from zero.” (<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/Latest-news-from-LSE/2020/L-December/Tax-cuts-for-the-rich">LSE</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>A report by the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Staff-Discussion-Notes/Issues/2016/12/31/Causes-and-Consequences-of-Income-Inequality-A-Global-Perspective-42986">IMF</a> (2015) found increasing income share of the poor increased economic growth, but increasing income share of the rich, led to lower growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We find that increasing the income share of the poor and the middle class actually increases growth while a rising income share of the top 20 percent results in lower growth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In the US, real GDP has grown faster than median wages since the early 1980s. In the 1980s, taxes were cut for high earners and there was a significant increase in inequality. Proponents of the Reagan tax cuts and supply-side economics argue it was worth it because everyone benefitted from rising GDP. However, the median wage, (which is the wage the middle-income earners actually receive has increased slower than real GDP, suggested not all the gains of the top 1% have trickled down to average workers.</p>

<p><strong>Inequality and lower growth</strong>. A recent report by the OECD found that since the start of the credit crisis in 2008, inequality has widened in many countries; however, this inequality has led to lower rates of economic growth not higher.</p>
<p>This graph from an OECD report suggests that inequality is responsible for lower GDP. The OECD estimates that the UK economy would have been more than 20% bigger had the gap between rich and poor not widened since the 1980s.</p>

<li>High-income earners have a high marginal propensity to save. Therefore, the increased disposable income from a tax cut does not filter into other sections of the economy because it is saved not spent. If it is spent it may go on imports, which are a withdrawal from economy.</li>
<li>Higher incomes may be used to accumulate wealth; this wealth accumulation leads to further capital gains and income from assets &#8211; leading to even higher levels of income and wealth inequality. The economist <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5002/economics/pros-and-cons-of-capitalism/">Thomas Piketty</a> argues that, unchecked, inequality can grow because the wealthy can keep re-investing their dividends and profit.</li>
<li>Higher GDP doesn’t address the fundamental inequality of capitalist society. Even if tax cuts did lead to higher economic growth, higher output does not necessarily lead to higher real incomes for all. Low-income workers may be left behind in certain types of economic growth. The UK recovery 2011-14 has been notable for low real income growth.</li>
<li>Budget deficit. Cutting taxes in the US led to an increase in the budget deficit. (from 2.7% of GDP in 1980 to 6% of GDP in 1983) Although this provides a temporary fiscal boost, a budget deficit creates problems for the future economy (possibility of higher interest rates, higher taxes in the future)</li>

<ul>
<li>Wrong target. If you want to reduce relative poverty, it makes sense to target income tax cuts and benefits at those who need it. Cutting taxes for the rich, in the hope some may trickle down to the poorest is a very inefficient way of working.</li>
<li>Cutting taxes does not necessarily increase incentives to work (both the <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/income-substitution-effect/">substitution and income effect</a> are at work and may cancel each other out).</li>
<li>It was hoped cutting income tax would encourage people to work overtime and work more hours. But in practice, this didn’t occur.</li>
<li>The wealthy can invest the extra wealth in assets, such as housing. However, this pushes up house prices, increasing the cost of living for lower-income groups.</li>

<h3>Ronald Reagan and the trickle-down effect</h3>
<p>Ronald Reagan was closely associated with the trickle-down effect in the 1980s. This is because, during his presidential term, he cut income tax for the high earners. He did not sell this policy on the grounds that ‘there will be a trickle-down effect.’ However, opponents often claimed that there was a limited trickle-down effect with median wages growing very slowly &#8211; compared to wages for the top 1% of income earners.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/inequality-90-2011-us.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3758 aligncenter" title="inequality-90-2011-us" src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/inequality-90-2011-us.jpg" alt="inequality-us" width="480" height="284" /></a></p>
<p>Top 1% gained an increased share of income, bottom 80% saw drop in income share. No trickle-down effect.</p>
<h3>Does higher company profit trickle down to the rest of society?</h3>
<p>Higher profit can trickle down to everyone in society.</p>
<ul>
<li>If profit is invested, new jobs are created.</li>
<li>If profit is saved in bonds and shares, it can help finance personal pensions.</li>
<li>Corporation tax means % is paid to the government for funding social spending.</li>
<li>Bill Gates and other billionaire philanthropists have given much of his wealth away to charity.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it depends on how profit is used.</p>
<p>In the past decade, US corporation profit has increased significantly, but this has not trickled down into higher real median incomes. <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/21282/business/cash-reserves/">Cash reserves</a> of many IT firms have risen significantly.</p>

<p>Note this figure for corporate profit is nominal (it does not include inflation. Inflation has averaged in the region of 2-3% a year since 1990)</p>
